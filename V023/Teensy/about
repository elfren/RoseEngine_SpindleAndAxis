Teensy 3.5 is used with the four axes board, while Teensy 3.2 is used with the two axes board.
Hex files for direct uploading to Teensy are located in the Teensy35 and Teensy32 folders.
The Nextion touch screen needs to be programmed to use 115200 baud.  This is done by first loading one of the hex files, 4Rose_V002_9600.hex, from either the Teensy35 or the Teensy32 folder. Once this is done, load one of the 4Rose_V003_115200.hex files.
